Terraform with Azure Provider Deployment Slot Walkthrough
===

In this walkthrough we will show you how to deploy two web apps via `GitHub` on `Azure`. One app will be assigned to the `Production Slot` and the second one will be hosted in the additional [deployment slot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing) which we will provision with `Terraform`. Finally, we will use `Terraform` to swap the inactive slot with the `Production Slot`.

Using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) deploy a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview), which is pre-configured with the latest version of `Terraform`. 

In the `Cloud Shell` bash window navigate to your `clouddrive` directory and create two directories, one called `deploy` and the other called `swap` as seen in the following image.

Navigate to your `deploy` directory and using `nano` copy and past the below `HCL` into a file called `deploy.tf`(i.e. `nano deploy.tf`).

```HCL
# Configure the Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" { }

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "slotDemo" {
  name = "slotDemoResourceGroup"
  location = "westus2"
}

resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "slotDemo" {
  name                = "slotAppServicePlan"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.name}"
  sku {
    tier = "Standard"
    size = "S1"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_app_service" "slotDemo" {
  name                = "slotAppService"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.name}"
  app_service_plan_id = "${azurerm_app_service_plan.slotDemo.id}"
}

resource "azurerm_app_service_slot" "slotDemo" {
  name                = "slotAppServiceSlotOne"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.slotDemo.name}"
  app_service_plan_id = "${azurerm_app_service_plan.slotDemo.id}"
  app_service_name    = "${azurerm_app_service.slotDemo.name}"
}
```
Once you have created the `deploy.tf` file you can now provision your resources to `Azure` using `Terraform` by typing the following commands.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Once `Terraform` has completed provisioning the resources you can use the `Resource Groups` tab in the `Azure Portal` to see the resources that were just provisioned by `Terraform`.

Click on the `slotDemoResourceGroup` and this will show each of the resources that were created.

We will need a web app to deploy to our `deployment slots`, fork the [awesome-terraform](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-terraform) repository to your own personal organization by clicking on the fork button in `GitHub` as seen in the image below.

Deploying Bits from GitHub to your Deployment Slots
---

1. We now have our bits, let's set them up to deploy from `GitHub` via the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Locate your `Resource Group`, as stated previously in this document, and click on the `slotAppService` resource then click on `Deployment options` button, as seen in the following image.

    ![Deployment Options](./assets/deploymentoptions.PNG)

3. Select the source of the deployment by clicking on the `GitHub` button as shown in the following image.

    ![Select Deployment Source](./assets/selectSource.PNG)

4. Once you have set up your Authorization and picked your personal organization we need to tell the `Azure Portal` which project we want to deploy from, click on the `Choose Project` option and select `awesome-terraform` from the displayed menu items.

    ![Choose Project](./assets/chooseProject.PNG)

5. Now that we have defined what project we would like to deploy from, we also need to select which branch we should deploy from click on the `Choose branch` button and select `master` from the displayed menu items and clike `OK`as seen in the folowing image.

    ![Choose Branch](./assets/chooseBranch.PNG)

Once you click `OK`, the `Azure Portal` will begin building the project and deploy it to your `slotAppService` production slot. 

To set up deployment to our `slotAppServiceSlotOne`, we will follow the same steps as above except in **Step 1** we will click on the `slotAppServiceSlotOne` resource and in **Step 5** you will select the `working` branch instead of the `master` branch, as seen in the image below.

![Choose Working Branch](./assets/chooseBranchWorking.PNG)

Putting It All Together
---

At this point we have set up our `slotAppService` and our `slotAppServiceSlotOne` to deploy our `web app` from different branches in `GitHub`. You can now preview the `web app` to validate that it was successfully deployed to the `slots` by clicking on the `URL` on the resources `Overview` page, as seen in the image below.

![Resource URL](./assets/resourceURL.PNG)

 If everything was deployed correctly `slotAppService` should render a Blue page with the page title of **Slot Demo App 1** and the `slotAppServiceSlotOne` should render a Green page with the page title of **Slot Demo App 2**.

 In the browser you just validated the pages in, navigate to the `slotAppService` URL, this should be the page that renders in blue (do not close this browser window/tab). Now, go back to your `Azure Cloud Shell` session and navigate to the `swap` directroy we created in the previous step. On the `Azure Cloud Shell` command prompt type `nano swap.tf` then copy and paste the below `HCL` into the `nano` text editor and save the file.

```HCL
# Configure the Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" { }

# Swap the Production Slot with the Deployment Slot
resource "azurerm_app_service_active_slot" "slotDemoActiveSlot" {
  resource_group_name   = "slotDemoResourceGroup"
  app_service_name      = "slotAppService"
  app_service_slot_name = "slotappServiceSlotOne"
}
```

![Create the swap.tf file with nano](./assets/cloudShellSwap.PNG)

We now have the Terraform code to swap our `Production slot` with our `Deployment slot`, in the `Azure Cloud Shell` command prompt type the following commands.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Once `Terraform` has finished swapping the slots go back to the browser session/tab that is rendering the `slotAppService web app` and refresh the page. You will notice that the `web app` that was in your `slotAppServiceSlotOne` deployment slot has been swapped with the `Production slot` and that the page now renders green. To bring back the original bits that was originally in the `Production slot` just run the `swap.tf` again by typing terraform apply and the original code will be swapped again from the `Deployment slot` to the `Production slot`.
